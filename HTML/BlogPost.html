            <p>
              You're more than welcome to vist us! This website was designed in
              order to learn front end technologies such as: HTML and CSS codes.
              The reason behind this is that More than half of all jobs in the
              top income show significant demand for coding skills.

          "Web design is tricky. One has to take a lot of things into account
          when designing a website, from visual appearance (how the website
          looks) to functional design (how the website works). To simplify the
          task, we’ve prepared this guide."
        </p>
        <p>
          "In this article, we’ll focus on the main principles, heuristics, and
          approaches that will help you to create a great user experience for
          your website. We’ll start with global things, like the user journey
          (how to define the “skeleton” of the website) and then work down to
          the individual page (what should be considered during web page
          design). We’ll also cover other essential aspects of design, such as
          mobile considerations and testing."

        <h2>Designing the user journey</h2>
        <h3>Information architecture</h3>
        <p>
          People often use the term “information architecture” (IA) to mean the
          menus on a website. But that’s not correct. While menus are a part of
          IA, they are only one aspect of it. IA is all about the organization
          of information in a clear and logical way. Such organization follows a
          clear purpose: helping users to navigate a complex set of information.
          Good IA creates a hierarchy that aligns with user’s expectations. But
          good hierarchy and intuitive navigation don’t happen by chance. They
          are a result of proper user research and testing. There are a number
          of ways to research user needs. Often, an information architect will
          take an active part in user interviews or card sorting, where the
          architect would hear of user expectations directly or see how
          prospective users would categorize a variety of information groups.
          Information architects also need access to the results of usability
          tests to see whether users are able to navigate efficiently.

            Card sorting is a simple way to figure out how best to group and
            organize content based on user input. One of the reasons why
            information architects like card sorting is because of the clarity
            of patterns that typically emerges. Image Source: FosterMilo

        <p>
          A menu structure would be created based on the results of user
          interviews, and card sorting would be tested for whether it satisfies
          the user’s mental model. UX researchers use a technique called “tree
          testing” to prove that it will work. This happens before designing the
          actual interface.
